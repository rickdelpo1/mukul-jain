The plugin approach makes it modular, want to handle images with optimisation and lazy loading, install <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-image</code>, need convert Markdown to HTML? install <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-transformer-remark</code> and leave all the work to Gatsby.</p>\n<h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Few pages (ex. Home, about, contact, products )</li>\n<li>SEO</li>\n<li>Progressive image loading</li>\n<li>Fast page loading</li>\n<li>Highly customisable</li>\n<li>Intelligent data prefetching</li>\n</ol>\n<br />\n<h3>Pages</h3>\n<p>Whether use any framework or not to register every page we manually have to link them with speicifc routes. Gatsby does this automatically, just create a <code class=\"language-text\">js|jsx</code> file in pages folder and that page is linked to route same as file name, there is 404 page (404.js) too which is rendered for every other route.</p>\n<p>Same goes for Markdown files or any other format, Gatsby knows what inside the folder, it fetched everything using file systema and dumped all to GraphQL, one can named export any query from any component and that will be available as props. That's how the blog listing works in this site.</p>\n<h3>SEO</h3>\n<p>All the pages are SSR rendered improving the SEO autmatically besides, it's also provide <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-react-helmet</code> which allows for different meta tags based on page, use <code class=\"language-text\">Helmet</code> component and write all SEO related meta tags inside it, rest of things will taken care.</p>\n<h3>Progressive image loading</h3>\n<p>While loading a website a a low quality is loaded first (~ 20px x 20px) and when user scrolls to that image or all other assets are fetched high resolution image will be loaded.</p>\n<h3>Fast page loading</h3>\n<p>On initial load a partial page is loaded which have the layout and all the text, HTML + CSS mostly and in next fraction of seconds JS is fetched and parsed which makes the bootstrap the React and routing capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Highly customisable</h2>\n<p>There are two types of API exposed</p>\n<p>Many events like <code class=\"language-text\">onInitialClientRender</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">onRouteUpdate</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">disableCorePrefetching</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">onCreateDevServer</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">onCreatePage</code> are exposed and some of them can be overwritten while others act as hooks. This can be done by creating a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gatsby-browser.js</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gatsby-node.js</a></p>\n<h3>Intelligent data prefetching</h3>\n<p>Can the page get more faster? Yes! As all pages server side rendered there static data (generated by GraphQL) can be pre-fetched after the current page finishes loading, this happens for the next accessible pages from the current page <strong>which are in viewport</strong>. Things for generated Markdown pages are even better, as you can seen in the gif, as I am scrolling down the data for each blog is fetched and when I click on a blog (last one in this case), it instantly loads, it's HTML was already fetched what loads after clicking, assets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/mukul-jain/edd427320fb48377bd343f61c5522859/pre-fetching.gif\" alt=\"Data pre fetching demo\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Automation</strong> is what Gatsby did, it took the best pratices and optimisation techniques and applied them during the build time and website which were already easy to make again due to automation at development time became more optimized and faster in production, not only static website, one can create full fledged e commerce website with Gatsby, that's why it matter.</p>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://github.com/mukuljainx/mukul-jain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this blog's Github Repo</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 26, 2021","slug":"/blog/Gatsby-smart-way-to-build-static-websites","title":"Gatsby: Smart way to build websites"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ee152205-7c1c-55b6-9a24-a3f1d04c13a9","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/Gatsby-smart-way-to-build-static-websites","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3897982121"]}
