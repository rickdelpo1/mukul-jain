This might sound silly but has a long-lasting effect on development and the way we define things because this is the architecture of that app that might belong to a far bigger ecosystem or it might be the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>For small apps, anything will work but problems start when the app grows, especially when you are working in an ecosystem. I work as a senior UI developer at <a href=\"https://innovaccer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">InnovAccer</a> and here we have a bunch of UI apps coupled together in a shell and work flawlessly as a single page app, we call it <strong>Engine,</strong> you can read more about it <a href=\"https://dev.to/aregee/breaking-down-the-last-monolith-micro-frontends-hd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now one of them was growing at a fast pace and two teams were working on it, from releasing the new version and maintaining the codebase, we were dependent on each other and we decided it‚Äôs not working anymore and we decoupled the app into two relatively smaller apps.</p>\n<p>We followed a flat structure ( never liked it though ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and while decoupling I was going through every part of the app, I realized how much easier it would have been if we would have followed domain-driven design principles or domain-driven structure not only to decouple but also maintaining it and using some component inside other that would have been easier. What are DDD and flat structures? Let‚Äôs start with the flat structure.</p>\n<h2>Flat Structure</h2>\n<p>Now it doesn‚Äôt mean each file should be at the root level, that would be the worse structure to follow even for small apps. It means having a folder for each kind of functionality.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 940px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/mukul-jain/static/746e3d6f67d738be293311634c17ebfe/f79fa/flat.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51.5625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Flat Structure\"\n        title=\"Flat Structure\"\n        src=\"/mukul-jain/static/746e3d6f67d738be293311634c17ebfe/f79fa/flat.png\"\n        srcset=\"/mukul-jain/static/746e3d6f67d738be293311634c17ebfe/6f3f2/flat.png 256w,\n/mukul-jain/static/746e3d6f67d738be293311634c17ebfe/01e7c/flat.png 512w,\n/mukul-jain/static/746e3d6f67d738be293311634c17ebfe/f79fa/flat.png 940w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Like here they have divided the functionality or behaviour they pose but not by how &#x26; where they are used.</p>\n<p>Now this structure is not bad at all and you must have seen this at many tutorials and it sort of makes sense for small projects until it stays small but when the app grows it should be migrated to Domain-Driven Structure, do it even before it becomes this big and you know it is going to be, but why?</p>\n<h2>Domain-Driven Structure</h2>\n<p>What is domain-driven design architecture, we have to read the whole book to fully understand it or maybe this <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">quick book</a>, loosely in layman‚Äôs term it‚Äôs the plan of your architecture around the domain or problem, it emphasises placing the primary focus of a project on the core area of the business (the core domain).

You can add each submodule as a module option in webpack too.</p>\n<p><strong>Chunking:</strong> All the dependent code is inside the single folder and can be shipped as a chunk.</p>\n<p>There will be cases when you need to show one component inside another, let say you need to show comments component inside post, you must export a component from comment to do so then rest should be handled by the comment component because you plugged this component there, data flow can be maintained using callbacks (props) or events.</p>\n<h2>Perfect Architecture?</h2>\n<p>No, I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs perfect, it might have downfalls, one is too many folders, that‚Äôs why flat structure is better for a small project, but once it‚Äôs started growing switch to DDD before it‚Äôs too late.</p>\n<p>So what's the catch, people are a little reluctant towards it because having an API folder in each module seems more troublesome than having one API folder at the root level, there are two reasons behind this feeling, one is familiarity as all tutorials have flat structure so it seems more familiar and easy to navigate, another is they haven‚Äôt realized the power of it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, the structure should be easy to navigate and comfortable for your team, for a small project one can choose a flat structure, for a bigger project there is no harm in trying or migrating to DDD and choose which is the best for you.</p>\n<p>Please let me know in the comments which one you and your team follow and what pros and cons you see in both patterns.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 08, 2021","slug":"/blog/creating-scalable-frontend-architecture","title":"Creating Scalable Frontend architecture"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"54ab08f6-ddcd-59bf-823a-fbd043532947","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/creating-scalable-frontend-architecture","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3897982121"]}
